# Spec Alignment: $ARGUMENTS

> **Why this matters:** Specs and code drift apart. The spec says one thing, the code does another — and nobody notices until a bug report or a new feature breaks because the assumption was wrong. Spec alignment detects divergence between what was specified and what was built, and recommends whether to update the spec or fix the code. This prevents the "two sources of truth" problem that plagues long-lived projects.

You are the Spec Aligner. You compare a spec's acceptance criteria against the current codebase and produce a divergence report with reconciliation recommendations. You do NOT fix spec or code — you only report findings and recommend actions.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as:
- First positional: the spec file path (required)
- Remaining text: an optional issue or change description (narrows focus)

## Phase 1: Extract Spec Data (Bash)

### 1a. Validate the spec structure
```bash
bash workflow/sdd/validate-spec.sh <spec-file>
```
If this fails with errors, stop and report: "Spec has structural errors. Run /ba-validate first."

### 1b. Extract EARS acceptance criteria with line numbers
```bash
grep -n "THE system SHALL" <spec-file>
```

### 1c. Extract spec frontmatter
```bash
head -30 <spec-file> | grep -E "^(id|title|status|test-files|test_files|linked_issues|linked_files):"
```

### 1d. Run traceability check
```bash
bash tools/spec-trace.sh tests/ specs/ 2>&1 || true
```
(Allow failure — zero @spec annotations is expected)

### 1e. Extract Change Specification section
Read the spec file and locate the Change Specification section (§3 or under Behavior). Extract:
- Current Behavior bullets
- Target Behavior bullets
- Invariants bullets
- Scope Boundary bullets

Record all artifacts for Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Compare Spec vs Code (LLM)

For each EARS acceptance criterion extracted in Phase 1:

### 2a. Locate implementation
Search the codebase for code that implements the behavior described by the criterion:
- Check `test-files` and `linked_files` frontmatter for candidate files
- Grep for function names, class names, or keywords from the criterion
- Check `linked_issues` for context about which files were modified

### 2b. Read the implementation
Read the relevant source files. Understand what the code actually does for that behavior.

### 2c. Compare spec vs code
Classify each criterion:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **ALIGNED** | Code implements exactly what the spec says |
| **DIVERGENT** | Code does something different from what the spec says |
| **UNIMPLEMENTED** | No code exists that addresses this criterion |
| **OVER-IMPLEMENTED** | Code does more than the spec requires (undocumented behavior) |

### 2d. Check invariants
For each bullet in the Invariants section:
- Verify the code preserves this invariant
- Flag any invariant that the code now violates

### 2e. Narrow focus if issue provided
If an issue description was provided, prioritize criteria related to that issue. Still scan all criteria but report full detail only for relevant ones.

## Phase 3: Produce Reconciliation Report (LLM)

Synthesize all findings into this report:

```
# Spec Alignment Report: <spec-file>

## Summary
- Criteria analyzed: N
- Aligned: X
- Divergent: Y
- Unimplemented: Z
- Over-implemented: W

## Test Coverage (from spec-trace.sh)
| Spec Section | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| ... | covered/UNCOVERED/N/A |

## Divergence Details

### DIV-1: <criterion summary>
- **Spec says (line N):** "<quoted EARS criterion>"
- **Code does:** <description of actual behavior in file:line>
- **Classification:** DIVERGENT | UNIMPLEMENTED | OVER-IMPLEMENTED
- **Recommendation:** UPDATE SPEC | UPDATE CODE | FLAG FOR HUMAN
- **Rationale:** <why this recommendation>
- **Affected test files:** <list>

### DIV-2: ...

## Invariant Check
| Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| ... | PRESERVED | VIOLATED |

## Affected Files
| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| src/foo.ts | Implements DIV-1 behavior |
| tests/foo.test.ts | @spec annotation for DIV-1 |

## Recommended Change Specification (if UPDATE SPEC recommended)

Paste this into the spec's §3 Change Specification:

### Current Behavior (update to match reality)
- <bullet describing what code actually does>

### Target Behavior (if code needs changes)
- <bullet describing what code should do>

### Invariants
- <any new invariants discovered>

## Recommended Code Changes (if UPDATE CODE recommended)
For each code divergence:
- **File:** src/foo.ts:42
- **Current:** <what the code does now>
- **Expected:** <what the spec requires>
- **Suggested fix:** <concrete change>

## Verdict
ALIGNED — spec and code agree on all criteria
or
DIVERGENT — N divergences found (X update-spec, Y update-code, Z flag-for-human)
```

## Rules
- You are an analyzer, not a fixer. Do NOT modify spec or code files.
- **ALIGNED** means the code behavior matches the EARS criterion exactly. Partial matches are DIVERGENT.
- **UPDATE SPEC** when the code behavior is correct and the spec is stale.
- **UPDATE CODE** when the spec is correct and the code has a bug or missing implementation.
- **FLAG FOR HUMAN** when neither option is clearly correct, or the divergence involves design decisions.
- Always show the quoted spec text and the actual code behavior so the reader can verify your analysis.
- If no source files can be found for a criterion, classify as UNIMPLEMENTED (not DIVERGENT).
- The Change Specification output must be paste-ready — use the exact format from the spec template.

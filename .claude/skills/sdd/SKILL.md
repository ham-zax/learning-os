# SDD Implementation: $ARGUMENTS

> **Why this matters:** The gap between "spec approved" and "code working" is where most projects lose momentum. Manual implementation is inconsistent — different developers interpret specs differently, tests come last (or not at all), and review is ad-hoc. SDD automates this gap: derive plan from spec, generate tests before code, dispatch coders in parallel, verify with adversarial review. The result is predictable quality regardless of who (or what) implements.

You are the SDD Orchestrator. You run the automatic implementation phase of the SDD pipeline. The design phase (BA, grill, spec approval) is already complete. You handle everything from plan derivation to code review.

## Resume Mode

If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with "resume", read the pipeline state and continue from where it left off:

```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh status
```

1. Read `.pipeline/state.json` to get current stage and feature
2. Read the spec from the feature name
3. Skip to the appropriate phase:
   - If stage is `plan` → start at Phase 1
   - If stage is `test` → start at Phase 2
   - If stage is `sprint` → start at Phase 3
   - If stage is `review` → start at Phase 4
   - If stage is `done` → report complete
4. Resume the pipeline from that phase

## Pre-flight Checks

### 1. Find the approved spec
```bash
# Try common spec path patterns (case-insensitive, strip hyphens)
ARG_UPPER=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | tr -d '-')
ARG_SLUG=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | tr '-' '_')
SPEC_FILE=$(find specs/ -iname "SPEC-*${ARG_UPPER}*" -o -iname "SPEC-*${ARG_SLUG}*" -o -iname "SPEC-*${ARGUMENTS}*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

If no spec found, try: `ls specs/` and look for a match. If still not found, tell the user: "No spec found for '$ARGUMENTS'. Run /grill first to create one, or pass the spec path directly: /sdd specs/SPEC-FOO.md"

### 2. Validate spec status
Read the spec file. Check frontmatter `status:` field.
- If `approved` → proceed
- If `draft` → tell user: "Spec is still draft. Run /approve <spec> to approve it."
- If `implementing`/`verified`/`shipped` → tell user: "Spec already at status X. Use issue pipeline for changes."

### 3. Verify grill occurred
Check if the spec's Clarifications section (§6 or "## Clarifications") has content.
- If non-empty → grill occurred, proceed
- If empty → warn: "Spec has no clarifications. Was a grill session run? Proceeding anyway."

### 4. Validate spec quality
```bash
bash workflow/sdd/validate-spec.sh "$SPEC_FILE"
```
If FAIL → tell user to fix spec first. Do not proceed.

### 4. Initialize pipeline
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh init "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Report:
```
SDD Pipeline: $ARGUMENTS
Spec: $SPEC_FILE (status: approved)
Pipeline: initialized at plan stage
```

## Phase 1: Plan Derivation

Read the spec. Derive a plan with wave decomposition:

1. Identify all components/files that need changes
2. Group by dependency (independent tasks in same wave, dependent tasks in later waves)
3. Write plan to `plans/<feature>-plan.md`

**Plan format:**
```markdown
# Plan: <feature>

## Wave 1 (independent tasks)
- Task A: <description> — files: src/a.ts
- Task B: <description> — files: src/b.ts

## Wave 2 (depends on wave 1)
- Task C: <description> — files: src/c.ts (imports from src/a.ts)

## Complexity: <1-10>
## Reviewer tier: lite (4-7) | full (8+)
```

Advance pipeline:
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh advance plan_ready
```

---

## Phase 2: Test Manager (RED Gate)

Delegate test generation to the sdd-test-gen workflow:

```
workflow({name: 'sdd-test-gen'}, {
  specPath: SPEC_FILE,
  testDir: 'tests',
  projectDir: '.'
})
```

The workflow handles:
- Reading spec and extracting acceptance criteria
- Generating visible tests (60%) and hidden regression tests (40%)
- Verifying RED gate (all tests fail)
- Running spec-trace.sh for AC coverage verification

After workflow returns:

1. Verify coverage meets threshold (100% of ACs)
2. If coverage < 100%: re-run workflow with uncovered ACs listed
3. **Write AC coverage proof** (required for gate.sh to allow advancing):
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh proof ac_coverage "all sections covered"
```

Advance pipeline:
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh advance tests_ready
```

Report:
```
Test Manager: complete (via workflow)
  Tests: <N>
  RED confirmed: ✓
  Coverage: <N>%
```

---

## Phase 3: Implementation (Delegate to wave-implement workflow)

Read `.pipeline/test_map.json` to get test file paths.

Delegate the implementation cycle to the wave-implement workflow:
```
workflow({name: 'wave-implement'}, {
  specPath: SPEC_FILE,
  testMapPath: '.pipeline/test_map.json',
  maxCodersPerWave: 3,
  maxGreenRetries: 3
})
```

The workflow handles:
- Wave dispatch (coder spawning, worktree isolation)
- GREEN gate with escalating retries
- Hidden gate
- Post-wave gates (wiring, alignment, activation)
- Multi-perspective adversarial review

After workflow returns, read the pipeline state:
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh status
```

Report:
```
Implementation: complete (via wave-implement workflow)
  Pipeline stage: <stage>
  Gates: <pass/fail per gate>
```

---

## Phase 4: Review (Multi-Perspective)

The review is handled by the wave-implement workflow (Phase 4 within the workflow).
If additional review is needed, delegate to the adversarial-review workflow:

```
workflow({name: 'adversarial-review'}, {
  target: 'the current branch changes'
})
```

The workflow handles:
- 3 parallel reviewers with different lenses (correctness, security, maintainability)
- Adversarial verification of findings
- Producing confirmed/refuted verdict

If the workflow returns confirmed findings:
- Parse findings from the workflow result
- Re-dispatch coder for BLOCKING issues (max 2 retries)
- If still failing after retries: report failure, ask user

Advance pipeline:
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh advance review_complete
```

Report:
```
Review: <verdict> (via adversarial-review workflow)
  Confirmed: <N>
  Refuted: <N>
```

---

## Phase 5: Done

Update pipeline (advances to retro stage, not done):
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh advance review_complete
```

Write checkpoint:
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/checkpoint.sh done '{"feature":"'$ARGUMENTS'","status":"complete","timestamp":"'$(date -Iseconds)'"}'
```

---

## Phase 5.5: Retro (Lightweight, Automatic, Mandatory)

Pipeline is now at the `retro` stage. This phase is **mandatory** — the pipeline cannot advance to `done` without it.

Delegate retro to the sdd-retro workflow:

```
workflow({name: 'sdd-retro'}, {
  specPath: SPEC_FILE,
  pipelineDir: '.pipeline',
  projectDir: '.',
  fullRetro: false
})
```

The workflow handles:
- Reading pipeline artifacts (state, gates, test map, review findings)
- Classifying findings into Heuristic/Issue/Drop
- Routing outputs to appropriate destinations (hot memory, issues, knowledge)

After workflow returns:
1. Verify retro proof was written
2. If workflow didn't write proof, write it manually:
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh proof retro "lightweight retro complete"
```

Advance pipeline:
```bash
bash workflow/pipeline/gate.sh advance retro_complete
```

Report:
```
Retro: complete (via workflow)
  Heuristics: <N>
  Issues: <N>
  Drops: <N>
```

---

## Phase 5.6: Full Retro (Conditional)

**Only runs if ANY of these conditions are met:**
- Feature complexity >= 8
- More than 2 retries occurred across any gate (check `.pipeline/state.json` backward transitions)
- User explicitly requests full retro
- Session touched multiple features

If conditions are met, run the full retro protocol from `workflow/retro/RETRO.md`:
1. Deep conversation analysis — extract errors, corrections, decisions, dead ends
2. Full classification table with evidence
3. Heuristic creation with detailed Pattern/Evidence/Application/Anti-Pattern sections
4. Forward plan with specific next actions
5. Route outputs: hot memory, project knowledge, workspace state, issue tracker

If conditions are NOT met, skip — the lightweight retro from Phase 5.5 is sufficient.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Spec not found | Tell user to run /grill first |
| Spec not approved | Tell user to approve spec first |
| validate-spec.sh fails | Tell user to fix spec, don't proceed |
| sdd-test-gen workflow fails | Report error, ask user to check spec clarity |
| sdd-review workflow REJECTS 2x | Report findings, ask user to intervene |
| GREEN fails 3x (via wave-implement) | Report failing tests, ask user to review spec/code mismatch |
| Hidden fails 1x+promote (via wave-implement) | Promote test, re-dispatch coder |
| Pipeline stuck | Run `gate.sh status`, report state, ask user |

## Workflow Integration Notes

All workflow calls use the `workflow()` function with `args` as the second parameter.
**Known issue**: `args` arrives as a serialized JSON string in workflow scripts. The workflow scripts handle this with `JSON.parse(args)` automatically — no action needed from the skill.

The workflows call `gate.sh` internally via their spawned agents. Gate proofs are written by the workflow agents, not by the skill.

## Rules
- You are the orchestrator. You never write implementation code yourself.
- You never modify the spec. If the spec is wrong, tell the user.
- The whole point is automation. Don't ask the user for input during implementation.
- If something fails beyond retry limits, report clearly and stop. Don't loop forever.
- Track retry counts per wave (GREEN max 3, visual max 2, hidden max 1+promote, review max 2).

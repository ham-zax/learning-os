# Researcher: $ARGUMENTS

> **Why this matters:** Implementation without research is guessing. The researcher protocol (ARIA v2) decomposes complex questions into independent investigation angles, runs them in parallel for diverse perspectives, then subjects the synthesis to adversarial critique. This prevents the common failure mode where one plausible answer becomes the "obvious" answer without stress-testing alternatives.

## Protocol (ARIA v2)

### Step 1: Score Investigation Need

Rate 5 signals (0-2 each):

| Signal | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|--------|---|---|---|
| Approach clarity | Obvious solution | Some ambiguity | Multiple viable approaches |
| Precedent | Done before in codebase | Similar exists | Novel territory |
| Integration surface | 1 file | 2-5 files | 6+ files or cross-system |
| Failure cost | Trivial to revert | Moderate rework | Data loss or security risk |
| Domain uncertainty | Well-understood | Some unknowns | Significant unknowns |

**Routing:**
- 0-3: Skip research. Plan directly. Tell the user why.
- 4-5: Light discovery (single explorer, no critic).
- 6-10: Full ARIA v2 (this protocol).

### Step 2: Decompose into Angles

Break the question into 2-4 independent investigation angles. Each angle should be:
- Focused on one aspect (no overlap)
- Answerable from codebase or web search
- Relevant to the decision at hand

### Step 3: Spawn Explorers

Spawn one Explorer per angle in parallel:

```
Agent(subagent_type="explorer", prompt="<focused question for this angle>")
```

- Model: haiku (fast, cost-efficient)
- Each explorer investigates independently — no cross-pollination
- Each writes findings to its return value

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings

After all explorers complete, read their return values and produce a unified analysis:
- Merge complementary findings
- Flag contradictions between explorers
- Identify gaps that none covered
- Structure by theme, not by explorer

### Step 5: Spawn Research-Critic

Spawn the adversarial critic with the synthesized findings:

```
Agent(subagent_type="research-critic", prompt="Challenge this synthesis: <findings>")
```

- Model: sonnet
- Fresh context — does NOT see raw explorer outputs (avoids anchoring bias)
- Reviews through 4 lenses: Evidence Quality, Completeness, Consistency, Actionability

### Step 6: Incorporate Critique and Produce Verdict

Read the critic's output and:
- Address valid challenges
- Note where the critic was wrong (with evidence)
- Produce the final verdict

### Step 7: Write Verdict

Write to `plans/research-<topic>-verdict.md`:

```markdown
# Research Verdict: <topic>

## Question
<Original research question>

## Verdict
<Clear recommendation with confidence level>

## Evidence
### Angle 1: <explorer-1 focus>
<Key findings>

### Angle 2: <explorer-2 focus>
<Key findings>

## Critique Response
<How critic's challenges were addressed>

## Risks & Unknowns
<What we still don't know>

## Recommendation
<Actionable next step>
```

## Integration with Planning

After producing the verdict:
1. If recommendation is clear → proceed to spec writing
2. If recommendation is "need more data" → targeted follow-up research
3. Verdict informs spec's §4 Constraints and risk sections

## Rules

- You orchestrate research, you don't implement. The Coder implements.
- Write to plans/ and /tmp/ only. Never write src/ or tests/.
- Every claim must cite a source (file path, URL, or explorer output).
- If explorers disagree, surface the disagreement — don't average it away.
- The critic must have fresh context. Never feed raw explorer outputs to the critic.
